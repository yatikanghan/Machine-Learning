# 🛍️ E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis ML Project

##
## 👨🏻‍💻 Project Overview

 This project observed e-commerce customer behaviour in online shopping throughout my machine learning knowledge and techniques. Using a dataset of e-commerce customer behaviour, it obseved important aspects that influence online shopping and developing online shopping prediction models to enhance our business.
##

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze customer behaviour, purchase habit and satisfaction level.
- Identify how customers attracted, and how enhance business opportunity.
- Observation of different value comparison so that we focuses on our actual customers.
- Focus on our targeted audience, and improve our sales.
- It Helps businesses archive their goals and optimize their valuable assets.

## 🗣 Business Recommendations  

1️⃣ **Boost Retention** – Offere **5-10% discounts** or **loyality** to **Neutral/Very Unsatisfied consumers** to increase their repeat product purchases.  
2️⃣ **Personalized Marketing** – Identifying **top consumers** and provide **VIP services** & **targeted promotions** to enhance our revenue.  
3️⃣ **Optimize Discounts** – give **personalized discounting** for more product purchase, especially for unsestified consumers.  
4️⃣ **Enhance Engagement** – apply **email marketing campign** for that customers which is inactive for **30+ days** to connect them.
